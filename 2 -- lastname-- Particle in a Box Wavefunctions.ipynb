Given this Hamiltonian, we can write the Schrodinger equation as:\n","\n","$$ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\psi(x) = E \\psi(x) \\qquad 0 \\leq x \\leq a $$\n","\n","The goal now is to find a function, $\\psi(x)$, that satisfies the above equation.  This means that it has to be an eigenfunction of the second derivative operator.  There are three obvious functions that return the same function upon taking the second derivative: $\\sin$, $\\cos$ and $\\exp$.  Given that these functions are all possible solutions and that the second derivative operator is a linear operator, any linear combination of these three functions is also a possible solution to the above Schrodinger equation.  Luckily, these three functions are related by \n","\n","$$e^{i\\omega x} = \\cos(\\omega x) + i\\sin(\\omega x)$$\n","\n","and the second derivative of this function will return itself times a constant.  So the generic form of the solution to the wave function for a particle in a 1D box is\n","\n","$$\\psi(x) = A\\cos(\\omega x) + B\\sin(\\omega x)$$\n","\n","in which $A$ and/or $B$ could be complex.  The eigenvalue problem dictates that $\\omega = \\frac{\\sqrt{2mE}}{\\hbar}$.  The boundaries give us additional restrictions on the wavefunction.  Namely, the wave function must be zero at the boundaries, which implies that $\\psi(x=0) = 0$ and $\\psi(x=a) = 0$.  The first of these restrictions tell us that $A=0$ since $\\cos(0) = 1$. The second restriction gives:\n","\n","$$B\\sin(\\omega a) = 0 \\Rightarrow \\omega a = n\\pi \\qquad n=1,2,3...$$\n","\n","Thus we get $\\omega = \\frac{n\\pi}{a} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2mE}}{\\hbar}$ or $E_n = \\frac{h^2n^2}{8ma^2}$.
